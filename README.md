# Session-7

## In this assignment , We have to design the network (CIFAR10) generated from ENA's macro space search for image classification

## I have tried to include each and every skip connection (to the best of my visibility).							
## But because of large number of parameters(470,429)  and skip connection , model training is very slow . 
## It takes 45 minutes for 1 epoch to run	. I have run it for 15 epoch.
